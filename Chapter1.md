#Chapter One

There once was an a woman who owned a cake shop in Paris. 
Her cakes were known to not only be the most beautiful, but also the most delicious.
She never cared to leave her shop, as cakes were her whole life and the only thing she ate.
Next to her was a small dumpling shop whose aromas would make anyone within thirty feet mesmerized.
This man only though of dumplings and nothing more.
